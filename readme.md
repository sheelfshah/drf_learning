Django Rest Framework Practice

I have learnt drf and created a submission for an internship.

The most important files are:
    views.py
    models.py
    serializers.py

I have commented the code at places where it might be difficult to understand the code or where I chose to differ from the assigned task slightly, where I found that the modification improved understandability or eliminated redundant code/effort.

Along with these comments, read all the descriptions of the postman requests as they explain how the api works. Not all request have been shown since the requests are highly similar.
These requests are available in the postman_demo_requests file as a json.

I attempted to use query speed up but could not find a fitting place where it was actually needed, and since I was short on time, I chose to omit it.
